        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thai tea is incredibly popular and easy to make at home. 
            Many store-bought tea mixes are dyed with yellow food colouring to help give the drink its distinct orange colour.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Thai tea mix</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of half and half (can be substituted with coconut milk, whole milk, or sweetened condensed milk)</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil on a stovetop and add in tea mix and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved and let simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off stovetop and let the tea steep for at least 30 minutes. Generally the more concentrated it is the better it tastes.</li>
            <li>Strain the tea leave mix from the tea and let the tea cool.</li>
            <li>Fill glasses with desired amount of ice and pour in the cooled Thai tea, leaving enough room for your creamer of choice.</li>
            <li>Fill the remaining portion of the glass with your creamer of choice. For an 8 oz. glass, 2-3 tbsp of creamer is recommended.</li>
        </ol>
