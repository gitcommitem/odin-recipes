# TOP HTML Foundations Project - Recipe Site
2021/11/10 ~ 2021/11/11

## Objective

Using only HTML, create a recipe site that consists of a homepage and three recipe pages.

The homepage will contain links to the recipe pages.

Recipe pages will include the following:
* One image of the finished dish
* Description of the recipe
* Ingredients list
* Preparation and cooking steps

## Learnings

The biggest take away from completing this project was getting into the habit of making git commits while coding instead of just sitting down and writing everything out in one go.
